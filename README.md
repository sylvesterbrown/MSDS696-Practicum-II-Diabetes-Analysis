Proposal: Diabetes Data Analysis

Practicum II

Introduction: I want to dive into a dataset that allows me to explore some healthcare issues. I wanted to have one that gave the platform to analyze this issue in my home country, Ghana. My search did not yield the desired result. The dataset I settled on has significance to a growing concern in my home country and have close relatives who need to medicate and regulate this disease. My mother, father-in-law, sister in law have diabetes. My wife Gloria was placed on high alert during a pregnancy for gestational diabetes. Given that this disease hits close to home for me, I have chosen this as my project for practicum II.

Purpose of project: Showcase skills in data manipulation and engineering, exploratory data analysis, visualizations and Machine leaning.

The problems to solve are:
1.	What factors are best for predicting that someone has diabetes?
2.	Which machine learning tool is best for predicting the outcome?

Finding a Dataset: My dataset is from Kaggle.com. “https://www.kaggle.com/rahulsah06/machine-learning-for-diabetes-with-python”

Description: The Diabetes is a dataset hosted on Kaggle primarily for learning machine leaning tools. The dataset contains 9 characteristics for 768 individuals the categories are: 
Pregnancies
Glucose
BloodPressure
SkinThickness
Insulin
BMI
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age
Outcome

Analysis: To account for level of difficulty and creativity and showcase basic data science skills. I will do most of my analysis using Python. 

Timeline:
Week 2 – Research and Data Preprocessing
Week 3 – Explore Data in Multiple Formats (EDA part 1): Data munging and engineering
Week 4 - Explore Data in Multiple Formats (EDA part 2): visualization
Week 5 – Understanding the disease research – gestational diabetes
Week 6 – Machine learning
Week 7 – GitHub, PowerPoint presentation
Week 8 – Finalize deliverables and Submit Results

Future Work

Additional ideas I would like to pursue are:

    Explore other Machine learning Models to see if there are others that may predict the outcome better
    More detailed EDA using visualizations
    The effects if any of different random number seed and associated rand_interger ranges
